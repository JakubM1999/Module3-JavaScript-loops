I made this assignment by following the theme idea and I answered all of the questions there. I understand the basic idea behind loops as you can see in the repository or the link to replit.com. I also added some additional ways to answer the last question. I hope that I showed the nessesary skills to prove that I understand and have the abillity to write the basic loops.
